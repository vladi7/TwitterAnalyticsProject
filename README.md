Please see BigDataProjectReportFinal.pdffor information about this project. 
This project was only tested in Intellij with scala versions and spark versions described in the information paper above. 
The java version has to be switched to JavaFX 8 before it is going to run. This project also needs hadoop running on the port 9000.

Alternatively, there is a field you may use to enter the location of JSON file for data. However, you will still need to run the project with Hadoop running.
